# CFDEM Fluidised Bed Cases

This repository allows users to test the validity of Bond Number of simulations with previous models - using the humble fluidised bed. This is part of [publication pending]. 
Contained in this repo the CFDEM code (written by of Hanqiao Che and adapted by myself) for carrying out a fluidised bed CFDEM simulation, as well as a Python pre/post-processing package for the simulation.
While the paper is pending publication, if you end up using this package - feel free to cite Hanqiao's paper on coarse-grained CFDEM simulations (this paper was crucial in the making of this project)
